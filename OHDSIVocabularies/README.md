# OHDSI Vocabularies

This directory must have the OHDSI standard vocabularies. In order to download them, go to the official repository available at https://athena.ohdsi.org and select the following vocabularies:
- Snomed
- RXNorm

Then, extract the CSV files to this directory or other (but in that case, it is necessary to define the new directory in the settings file).
